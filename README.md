# GitHub REST API project

This project allowed me to improve my ablity to work with server request. GitHub API was used to create the application with primary function of searching among GitHub repositories. Users also could bookmark their favorite repositories (bookmarks are stored in LocalStorage) and choose application theme (light or dark). Project was created using React.js, Redux Toolkit (Redux Async Thunk was used to handle server requests).
